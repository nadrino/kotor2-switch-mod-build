Peragus Model Repairs v1.3.0

[Description:]
How did the Peragian miners die? Probably the lack of oxygen. Peragus faces many structural issues, from the gaps in the floors, walls, and ceilings, 
and other model errors, many of which expose the facility to the vacuum of space. It may be too late for the miners, but it's not too late for you. 
Let's get to work.

[Installation:]
Place this folder inside of your override folder, found in the same directory as your main game executable. For Steam installations, this would be 
"Steam\steamapps\common\Knights of the Old Republic II".

This mod builds upon the work started by DarthParametric with "Peragus Administration Level Room Model Fixes 1.0.0". I have recreated and improved 
upon the fixes of that mod from scratch, as well as included fixes to a very large number of other model issues. If you currently have the other mod 
installed, you should remove "[TSL]_Peragus_Administration_Level_Room_Model_Fixes" from your override upon installing this mod. If you have are 
updating from a previous version of the mod, just delete the old "Peragus_Model_Fixes" folder from your override. The version number is included in
the folder name.

[Uninstallation:]
Remove this folder from your override.

[Compatibility:]
Users should expect full compatibility with any other mods, so long as they do not modify/replace the files listed below. 

This mod works very well alongside "Peragus Large Monitor Adjustment 1.0" by Sith Holocron, and will correct the same asteroid image and text 
displacement issue from the asteroid exterior. It will similarly work well alongside other Peragus mods which affect textures or placeable models 
and lighting, such as VarsityPuppet's "Peragus Tweak 1.4", "A Darker Peragus REDUX 1.0" by Malkior, and "...A Darker Peragus 2.0" by Canderis. It is 
also compatible with backdrop improvement mods such as Kexikus' "TSL Backdrop Improvements 1.4", Vasilii Zaytsev's "Improved Peragus Asteroid Fields 
1.2", and Replacement Peragus II Artwork by Trench 1.0 uploaded by Sith Holocron. This mod is not compatible with DarthParametric's "Peragus 
Administration Level Room Model Fixes 1.0.0", but fixes the same issues (and many more).
